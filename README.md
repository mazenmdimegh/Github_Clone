# Github Clone Application

This project is a web application that allows users to search through GitHub repositories by name, using a search bar. The application is written using React and Typescript, and utilizes the official GitHub API to fetch repositories per user. The interface is responsive, and follows good user experience principles. Additionally, the code is documented.
